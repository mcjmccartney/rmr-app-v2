# Security Documentation

## 🔒 Security Improvements Implemented

### ✅ **Completed Security Fixes**

1. **🗑️ Removed Debug/Test Endpoints**
   - Removed `/api/debug-sessions` - exposed all session data
   - Removed `/api/debug-memberships` - exposed membership data
   - Removed `/api/simple-test` - revealed server information
   - Removed all `/api/test-*` endpoints - multiple test endpoints

2. **🛡️ Added Security Headers**
   - Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
   - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
   - Permissions-Policy for camera, microphone, geolocation

3. **⚡ Implemented Rate Limiting**
   - Default: 100 requests per 15 minutes
   - Webhooks: 50 requests per 5 minutes
   - Auth endpoints: 10 requests per 15 minutes
   - IP-based tracking with automatic cleanup

4. **🌐 Secured CORS Configuration**
   - Restricted to specific domains (hook.eu1.make.com)
   - Removed wildcard (*) origins
   - Added proper preflight handling

5. **🔍 Enhanced Input Validation**
   - Email sanitization and validation
   - String length limits and HTML tag removal
   - UUID format validation
   - Amount and date range validation
   - Removed sensitive error details from responses

6. **🔐 Environment Variable Security**
   - Created .env.example with security notes
   - Removed sensitive data from diagnostic logs
   - Added production environment checks

### 🚨 **Critical Actions Required**

1. **Database Security (URGENT)**
   ```sql
   -- Apply the secure RLS policies from supabase-security-policies.sql
   -- Current policies allow unrestricted access: USING (true) WITH CHECK (true)
   ```

2. **Webhook Authentication**
   - Consider adding webhook signature verification
   - Implement API key authentication for sensitive endpoints

3. **HTTPS Enforcement**
   - Ensure all production traffic uses HTTPS
   - Add HSTS headers for HTTPS enforcement

### 📋 **Security Checklist**

#### ✅ Application Security
- [x] Debug endpoints removed
- [x] Rate limiting implemented
- [x] Security headers added
- [x] Input validation enhanced
- [x] CORS properly configured
- [x] Error messages sanitized
- [x] Environment variables secured

#### ⚠️ Database Security
- [ ] **URGENT**: Apply secure RLS policies
- [ ] Test authentication after policy changes
- [ ] Verify public forms still work
- [ ] Ensure webhooks can insert data

#### ⚠️ Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Enable HTTPS-only in production
- [ ] Configure proper SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement backup and recovery procedures

#### ⚠️ Operational Security
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Log monitoring and analysis
- [ ] Incident response procedures

### 🔧 **Security Configuration Files**

1. **`src/lib/security.ts`** - Security utilities and rate limiting
2. **`supabase-security-policies.sql`** - Secure database policies
3. **`.env.example`** - Environment variable template
4. **`src/middleware.ts`** - Updated with security headers

### 🚨 **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Apply Database Policies** (CRITICAL)
   - Run `supabase-security-policies.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Test all functionality after applying
   - Verify public forms still work

2. **Test Security Implementation**
   - Verify rate limiting works
   - Test CORS restrictions
   - Confirm input validation
   - Check security headers in browser dev tools

3. **Monitor and Maintain**
   - Set up security monitoring
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Periodic security reviews

### 📞 **Security Incident Response**

If you suspect a security issue:
1. Document the issue immediately
2. Assess the scope and impact
3. Implement immediate containment
4. Apply permanent fixes
5. Review and improve security measures

### 🔄 **Regular Security Maintenance**

- **Weekly**: Review access logs for anomalies
- **Monthly**: Update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities
- **Quarterly**: Comprehensive security audit
- **Annually**: Penetration testing and security assessment

---

**⚠️ WARNING**: The current database policies are overly permissive and must be updated immediately for production use.
